# Neon
Neon is a lightweight, native GTK4 audio player designed for simple, distraction-free audio playback. It focuses on plug-and-play listening rather than library management or playlists. Neon is built for users who just want to open an audio file and listen—without scanning libraries, managing collections, or dealing with unnecessary UI complexity.
